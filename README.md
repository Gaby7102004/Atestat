# GitHubRepository

This has been my work for the past 1-2 months. I put a lot of effort into this and I hope it will serve me good for the future. I enjoyed every moment of creating this project and hopefully many more to come. The purpose of the project is to serve as my school homework for my final year in high school. Im proud of what I achieved and I hope I'll get better and better to create wonderfull things.
